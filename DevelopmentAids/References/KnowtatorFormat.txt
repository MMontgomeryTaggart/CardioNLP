This document describes the eHost .knowtator file format.

Knowtator files are XML files that contain annotation information. For each text file annotated with eHost a .knowtator file is produced that contains all the annotations for that text file. Any given annotation will have the following attributes:

1. Exactly one class.
2. Zero or more attributes.
3. Zero or more relationships.
4. A creation date.
5. Document span start and end values.
6. Spanned text.
7. An annotator name.
8. An annotator id.
9. A classMention ID.
10. Zero or more stringSlotMention ID's, one for each attribute.

Since this project does not use relationships (so far anyway) they will not be addressed in this document.

The annotation information is stored in the knowtator file in three main parent elements: "annotation", "classMention", and "stringSlotMention". 

The annotation element contains the spanned text, the span start and end values, the annotator name, annotator ID, creation date, and a reference to the classMention ID. 

The classMention element contains the classMention ID, the spanned text again, the class assigned to that text, and references to all of the stringSlotMention IDs.

The stringSlotMention element contains the stringSlotMention ID, the attribute field name, and the attribute field value. There is one stringSlotMention element for every attribute of the annotation.
A sample annotation is shown below:

    <annotation>
        <mention id="EHOST_Instance_600" />
        <annotator id="eHOST_2010">Shane</annotator>
        <span start="4908" end="4917" />
        <spannedText>DOC CLASS</spannedText>
        <creationDate>Wed May 31 11:37:23 EDT 2017</creationDate>
    </annotation>
    <stringSlotMention id="EHOST_Instance_630">
        <mentionSlot id="certainty" />
        <stringSlotMentionValue value="definite" />
    </stringSlotMention>
    <stringSlotMention id="EHOST_Instance_631">
        <mentionSlot id="present_or_absent" />
        <stringSlotMentionValue value="absent" />
    </stringSlotMention>
    <classMention id="EHOST_Instance_600">
        <hasSlotMention id="EHOST_Instance_630" />
        <hasSlotMention id="EHOST_Instance_631" />
        <mentionClass id="doc_classification">DOC CLASS</mentionClass>
    </classMention>
    <annotation>
        <mention id="EHOST_Instance_447" />
        <annotator id="eHOST_2010">Shane</annotator>
        <span start="163" end="184" />
        <spannedText>evaluation of SDH.</spannedText>
        <creationDate>Sun Jun 18 19:25:37 EDT 2017</creationDate>
    </annotation>
    <stringSlotMention id="EHOST_Instance_451">
        <mentionSlot id="certainty" />
        <stringSlotMentionValue value="definite" />
    </stringSlotMention>
    <classMention id="EHOST_Instance_447">
        <hasSlotMention id="EHOST_Instance_451" />
        <mentionClass id="bleeding_present">evaluation of SDH.</mentionClass>
    </classMention>
