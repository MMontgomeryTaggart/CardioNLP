Analysis
********

The collection of modules in the Analysis sub-package are designed to consume instances of Document and produce useful metrics. Currently there are two modules: DocumentComparison which can be used to compare the annotations contained in two sets of documents, and Output which can be used to convert the results of the comparison to an easily viewable format.
