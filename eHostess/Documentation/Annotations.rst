Annotations
***********

These modules contain classes that represent annotation objects, namely MentionLevelAnnotations and annotation Documents. All of the eHostess interfaces produce instances of these classes and all of the modules in Analysis are designed to consume them. They effectively standardize the annotations created by different sources and allow the user to compare annotation methods.
