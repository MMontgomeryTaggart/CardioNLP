Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 133**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIJ placed
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 80F with a history of severe AS, CAD, s/p nephrectomy
for RCC with ESRD recently started on HD and recent admission to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cough [**Date range (1) 134**] p/w cough. Today she woke up from
sleep with acute shortness of breath and cough. NO Chest pain.
Husband called 911. In the ER, afebrile HR 120s, SBP 110s. CXR
with ? PNA. She was given ceftriaxone 1 gram and levofloxacin
750mg IV X1. Given continued resp distress intubated (rocuronium
and etomidate).
On presentation to the CCU pt intubated unable to provide
history. Per husbandpt has had a severe cough since discharge
from hosp productive for clear sputum. Overall has had a cough
for ~3 mos (had been treated for PNA X2 most recently [**3259-6-29**]).
She saw her cardiologist and who stopped her ramipril and
switched her to losartan 1 day PTA. She has not had any fevers,
nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. Of note she had aoritc
valvuloplasty on [**3259-6-24**] (initially valve area 0.56cm2, gradient
27 -> after the procedure the calculated aortic valve area was
0.74 cm2 and gradient 12 mmHg.) Pt has been on dialysis in the
past but with improvement in creatinine she was not dialysed on
Thursday (last dialysis [**3259-7-8**]).

Pertinent Results:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**5-/3259**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated heavily calcified
left
main, left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The
left circumflex had a heavily calcified proximal lesion.
2. LV ventriculography was deferred.
3. Successful Rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal left circumflex artery with a Cypher (3x13mm) drug
eluting stent postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA Comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal LCX with a drug eluting stent (Cypher).
.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**3259-7-4**] demonstrated:The left
atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

EKG on admission-Sinus tachycardia with left bundle-branch block
with secondary ST-T wave
abnormalities. No diagnostic change from tracing #1.
.
[**Month/Day/Year **] on admission - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral
walls and mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments
(LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small, primarily anterior (?loculated)
pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise
with a prominent anterior fat pad.
.
[**7-21**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left
bundle-branch block.
Left axis deviation. Secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**3259-7-19**] heart rate has increased. Otherwise,
no major
change.
.
CXRs over the course of admission showed slowly improving
pulmonary edema, no major focal consolidations were seen.
.
Renal US - no hydronephrosis, patent renal artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
# PUMP/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure:
Patient presented with presumed acute exacerbation of chronic
systolic heart, which has improved after ultrafiltration. [**Date Range **]
with EF of 30-40% unchanged from prior. She currently appears
fairly euvolemic, however her fluid status has remained
difficult to manage given her low ejection fraction and poor
urine output.
- Continued home doses of carvedilol and losartan.  Were held
initially for low blood pressures, but both restarted during her
admission.
- Hemodialysis was considered for fluid managment, but a trial
of lasix proved successful.  She will now go home on 160 mg PO
daily lasix and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 117**], her nephrologist.
She will monitor daily weights/low sodium diet, pt had nutrition
consult during stay.
.
# CAD: No evidence ACS during hospitalization. Patient is s/p
recent LCx stent.  She was continued on ASA, carvedilol, plavix,
and Losartan.

.
#. Valves. No active issues. Severe AS a/p valvuloplasty
[**3259-6-25**], stable AS per [**Month/Day/Year **]. Discussed with patient and family:
per their report, patient was previously evaluated by Dr.
[**Name (NI) 136**] in cardiac surgery and was not a candidate for valve
replacment due to "calcifications." Patient may be candidate for
new cath-assisted valve replacement. Also has mild MR on last
[**Name (NI) 112**].  Pt should likely be re-evaluated after discharge.
.
# Respiratory distress resolved -
Respiratory distress was suspected to be likely multifactorial
secondary to volume overload and also PNA as supported by
elevated WBC on presentation, fever, and now GNR in sputum gram
stain but not growing on culture. Increased sputum overnight
while afebrile, non-elevated white count likely represents
resolving infection. Received monotherapy with ceftazadime only
given GNR in sputum may be pseudomonas; antibiotics started
[**7-13**], continued for 7 days.  She will continue lasix as
outpatient to try and prevent pulm edema.
.
# ANEMIA/GIB:
HCT drop was noted several two days into admission, unclear if
represented true blood loss. NGT removed [**7-15**] and this
demonstrated frank dark blood (+hemoccult) in NGT, likely
representing bleed several days ago from gastritis. LDH and
haptoglobin were checked with HCT drop and were within normal
limits which is inconsistent with hemolysis. She received 1 u
PRBCs soon after admission, and HCT has remained stable since.
Her Hcts were between 26 and 28.  Stools were checked for guiac,
and were positive two days prior to dicharge.  We discharged her
home with protonix and recommend follow up with her PCP to
continue to monitor CBCs for watch for blood loss.  She is not
actively losing blood as seen by her stable Hcts.  We also
recommend an outpatient colonoscopy.  Although, she needs to be
very careful with the bowel prep, as that can cause large fluid
shifts and drive her into pulmonary edema.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure (stable Cr):
Acute on chronic renal failure likely due to ATN secondary to
hypotension versus ongoing pre-renal state. Patient had been
initiated on HD in [**3259-4-29**]; was taken off HD ~1 week prior to
admission. Volume overload/CHF on admission, improved with UF,
now appears euvolemic. Creatinine 1.... on discharge.  Pt has
history of RCC with nephrectomy.  Renal function has seemed to
normalize.  Will continue follow up with nephrologist and he
will also coordinate removal of dialysis catheter.

#  Pt was discharge to home with services for PT and home health
care for dialysis catheter dressing changes.

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service

Facility:
[**Hospital 118**] Homecare

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnoses:
1. Respiratory Failure
2. CHF
3. Renal Failure

Secondary Diagnoses:
1. Aortic Stenosis
2. Anemia
3. HTN


Discharge Condition:
Stable, afebrile, pt walking with a walker, eating on her own,
with a normal mental status.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for respiratory distress due to fluid in your
lungs from an acute episode of worsening heart failure.  You
were intubated at the time, and when you were able to breath on
your own, we continued to remove fluid from your lungs with
diuretics.  We also are continuing to give you the medicines
carvedilol and losartan for your heart failure.

You also will start taking lasix daily to ensure fluid stays off
your lungs.

In addition, you had acute renal failure during this admission.
Your kidney function improved, but you will continue to need
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 117**].  You also have a dialysis catheter in
your chest that will need to be taken care of by a home nurse.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 117**] will discuss removal of the catheter as an
outpatient.

We also found a trace amount of blood in your stool.  You should
meet with your PCP and discuss having a colonoscopy.  Make sure
to tell them you have heart failure because it does affect the
bowel preparation they plan for you.

Once at home, weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 137**] MD if weight >
3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.  Call the nutritionist with any
questions.

Also, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest
pain, dizziness or fainting or any other worrisome symptoms, do
not hesitate to call your doctor or call 911 in case of
emergency.
