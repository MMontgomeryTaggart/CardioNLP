Chief Complaint:  Hematemesis
   Admit to MICU for: UGIB
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4716**] is a 70 yo man with a history of COPD with approximately
   thrice yearly hospitalizations for exacerbations, HTN, CHF, CVA,
   lung CA s/p resection, and AAA s/p repair [**1-9**] presenting with
   hematemesis. Of note he was discharged from [**Hospital1 52**] [**9-23**] for URI/COPD
   exacerbation.  This am noted he felt weak/lightheaded upon arising from
   bed, fell to floor. Had 1x episode of vomiting maroon blood.  Continued
   to have sx of lightheadedness.  At time of presentation to ED, was HD
   stable with VS 98.6 88 156/85 18 100% 2L.  Reported some CP day prior
   to admission, currently resolved.  Did have some elevated LFTs on
   initial testing with RUQ tenderness. A RUQ u/s was done which showed
   some evidence of GB swelling without CBD dilitation.  Got 2L IVF in ED
   as well as nebs and IV PPI. Pt guaiac negative on exam.  CXR was
   negative for evidence of new infiltrate. ECG unchanged.
   .
   On ROS pt notes that he did fall and hit head this morning, does not
   think he lost consciousness.  Had also fallen a few weeks ago and hit
   his coccyx, has some pain there when he sits.  Denies recent chest
   discomfort or shortness of breath. Does endorse worsening cough over
   past week productive of sputum. States that he had ~500cc of maroon
   hematemesis after falling, says this happened before in [**Month (only) 2548**] when he
   had an UGIB at an OSH but it was a higher volume then. No nausea. No
   abd pain, no constipation or diarrhea. Last BM earlier today.

   THICKENING AND EDEMA OF THE WALL OF THE GALLBLADDER WITHOUT INTRA OR
   EXTRA HEPATIC BILIARY DILATATION. HIDA SCAN RECOMENDED TO EXCLUDE
   ACALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS
   .
   CXR:Unchanged, no acute process.
   ECG: NSR at 66, LBBB, LVH, LAD, RA abnormality.  No change from prior.
   Assessment and Plan
   70M with h/o COPD with recent hospitalization for COPD exacerbation on
   steroid taper, AAA s/p repair presenting with fall and hematemesis on
   aspirin found with transaminitis, RUQ tenderness, gallbladder swelling
   and leukocytosis
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Hematemesis:</I>Per report pt had single episode of maroon
   hematemesis, unclear volume. Is guaiac negative so if GI source, has
   not been significant or of prolonged duration. Ddx is broad  GI vs oral
   vs pulmonary source. Pt has history of lung ca s/p resection, has
   history of acute cough/possible bronchitis.  He had GIB in [**Month (only) 2548**] at OSH,
   unclear etiology, per PCP was [**Name Initial (PRE) **] duodenal bleed.  Another more ominous
   possibility is an aorto-enteric fistula from his graft, however the
   patient has had no other symptoms such as chest pain and is currently
   hemodynamically stable.
   -GI aware, no plans for emergent/urgent scope.  NPO after MN for
   possibly EGD
   -2PIV
   -IV PPI, may switch back to home dose when taking PO
   -Active T+S
   -Check HCT in am, if stable may move to Q24.
   -switch asa to 81mg
   -decrease BB, hold other anti-hypertensives overnight, if HD stable,
   may restart in am.
   .
   <I>## RUQ pain:</I>Unclear picture with transaminitis without ductal
   dilatation and some gall bladder swelling. Pt is on steroids, reports
   vague history of poor appetite with 25lb wt loss over 3 months, at risk
   for acalculous cholecystitis.
   -HIDA scan
   -f/u blood cx
   .
   <I>## COPD:</I>Continue steroid taper, advair, duonebs
   .
   <I>## HTN:</I>Decreased dose of BB, holding other antihypertensives
   until am, may restart HCTZ or ACEI in am if stable, no further bleeding
   overnight.
   .
   <I>## HL:</I>Continue statin
   .
   <I>## Cardiomyopathy:</I>Restart ACEI in am
   .
   <I>## Leukocytosis:</I>Ddx includes steroid induced leukocytosis,
   recent URI, cholecystits.  UA bland, unlikely source.
   -Continue to trend
   -f/u blood cultures
   .
   <I>## Falls:</I>Head CT read pending. On prelim look no overt bleed. No
   focal neuron deficits.
   -f/u final read CT
   -Fall precautions
